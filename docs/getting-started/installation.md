# Installation

Expose can be installed using composer.  
The easiest way to install expose is by making it a global composer dependency:

```bash
composer global require beyondcode/expose
```

Now you're ready to go and can [share your first site](/getting-started/share-your-first-site).

### Extending Expose

By default, expose comes as an executable PHAR file. This allows you to use all of the expose features, like sharing your local sites, out of the box - without any additional setup required.

If you want to modify expose, for example by adding custom request/response modifiers, you will need to clone the GitHub repository instead.

You can learn more about how to customize expose in the [extending Expose](/extending) documentation section.
