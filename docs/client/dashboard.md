# Dashboard

Once you share a local site, expose will show you all incoming HTTP requests along with their status code and duration in your terminal:

While this is great to get a quick look of the incoming requests, you sometimes need more information than this.

Because of that, expose is also exposing a web based dashboard on port 4040.

Once you start sharing a site, expose will show you a QR code that you can scan with your mobile device, to easily browse your shared sites on your phone or tablet.

Once a request comes in, you can see all incoming HTTP requests as they hit your local site in realtime.
When you click on a specific request, you can see detailed information about the request and response.
