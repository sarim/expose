# Dashboard

Once you share a local site, Expose shows you all incoming HTTP requests along with their status code and duration in your terminal:

While this is great to get a quick look of the incoming requests, you often need more information than this.

Because of that, Expose is also exposing a web based dashboard on port 4040.

Once you start sharing a site, Expose shows you a QR code that you can scan with your mobile device, to easily browse your shared sites on your phone or tablet.

When a request comes in, you can see all incoming HTTP requests as they hit your local site in realtime.
You can click on a specific request and see detailed information about the request and response. Expose provides several tools for developers to make webhook testing easier â€“ the most powerful one is that you can replay requests without firing the webhook again. So if your previous process required to create multiple test orders to see how the paylods of your payment provider look like, Expose makes this a breeze by allowing you to replay these requests without creating more orders.
