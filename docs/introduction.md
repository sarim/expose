# Introduction

Expose is an open source tunnel application that allows you to share your local sites and applications with others on the internet.

You can host your own Expose server and customize the application to your own needs or create a [free Beyond Code Account](https://beyondco.de/login) and use our managed infrastructure. The managed Expose network has a free plan that uses the test infrastrcture in our data center in Germany â€“ and a Pro plan that uses the global Expose network with access points in all over the world.

If you decide to host your own server, you can extend Expose with additional features and middleware classes on the server and client side. This gives your the full flexibility of true customization but comes with some maintenance overhead.

Expose itself comes with a beautiful CLI view and a web-based dashboard that show you incoming HTTP requests on the client.

Expose is the alternative to ngrok for PHP developers.
